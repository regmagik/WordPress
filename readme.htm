<h2>Review</h2>
<p>One of RegmagiK users wrote this review:</p>
<i><p>"I would like to thank you Boris for writing this wonderful RegmagiK software. It has helped me to resolve many registry problems I have had on my computer. I discovered your software by search when my computer was infected by a nasty virus. This virus had locked me out of my registry and modified data to keep me from running virus scans. I new the only solution would be a third party software to grant me access to my registry. After discovering this wonderful software, I was able access my registry and make the changes needed to return my computer to an operable state and successfully remove the virus. This is only one of it's near infinite abilities. One of my favorite features is the ability to bookmark important keys for near instant access. This prevents hours of searching for a key who's location you had forgotten. I strongly recommend this software to any registry enthusiast. Boris, your software is truly worth hundreds but at your very reasonable price of $15, one would be foolish not to invest in a copy. Thank you for giving this software to the world.
</p>
<p>Best Regards,
</p>
<p>Shaun"
